Search a system using these IOCs to find evidence of various files and malware that is hiding.​

Learn how to use IOCs to search an entire system for any evidence of them, allowing you to identify suspicious or malicious files used values such as strings, MD5 hashes, file names, file size, and more.​

You will be given a system image, which you must load as a virtual machine, and use techniques to generate IOCs from two malware samples, and then search the system to find all other copies of the malware that are hidden deep inside.
