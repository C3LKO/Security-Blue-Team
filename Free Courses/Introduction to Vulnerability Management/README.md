Set up the intentionally vulnerable virtual machine Metasploitable 2, created by security firm Rapid7. This will be your test environment where you can practice vulnerability scanning, collecting results, and analysing them to produce vulnerability reports.

Install and explore the Nessus Essentials vulnerability scanner created by Tenable, in preparation for the final course challenge.​ You’ll be walked through the GUI and conduct a scan against your own system, so that you’re familiar with how to use this powerful tool, and understandscan results.​

Analysing real-world WPScan results to make sure you’re familiar with the tool’s output. and the security flaws that it can detect. In the future we will release a public lab where you can conduct your own scans.​

Conduct a short and simple vulnerability assessment of the Metasploitable 2 system, by launching your own vulnerability scans using Nessus, and reporting on the vulnerabilities and flaws that are discovered.​
